## Challenge
In this challenge you are expected to build a React application based on [this Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/ifTgtq7UTQ9j7PCkUzUpP4/UI-Task?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=g2Q3p1x2sp2xLuCB-1). 

You would need to code the following:
1. The application consists of two pages. The landing page will have a table which consolidates all appliance data. 
2. Clicking the view button in any row should take the user to the second page which provides the specific appliance information. 
3. You are also expected to write your own mock API server which serves the data following the [API specification](./FrontEnd_Hiring_Challenge_APIs.yml).

### Timeline
Try to complete this within a week.

### Submission
Please push your code (including the code to run the mock API server) to your personal GitHub account and share the repository link.
